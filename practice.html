    <h1><ins>History of vechiles</ins></h1>
    <p>A vehicle (from Latin vehiculum)[1] is a machine designed for self-propulsion, usually to transport people,
        cargo, or both. Vehicles include wagons, bicycles, motor vehicles (motorcycles, cars, trucks, buses, mobility
        scooters), railed vehicles (trains, trams), watercraft (ships, boats, underwater vehicles), amphibious vehicles
        (screw-propelled vehicles, hovercraft), aircraft (airplanes, helicopters, aerostats), and spacecraft.</p>
    <aside>
        <p>Ground vehicles can be broadly classified by the type of contact with the ground: wheels, tracks, rails, or
            skis. ISO 3833-1977 is the international standard for road vehicle types, terms, and definitions.</p>

            <h2>Types of vehicles</h2>
            <p>There are over 1 billion bicycles in use worldwide.</p>
        </header>
        In 2002 there were an estimated 590 million cars and 205 million motorcycles in service in the world.[25][26] At
        least 500 million Chinese Flying Pigeon bicycles have been made, more than any other single model of
        vehicle.[27][28] The most-produced model of motor vehicle is the Honda Super Cub motorcycle, having sold 60
        million units in 2008.[29][30] The most-produced car model is the Toyota Corolla, with at least 35 million made
        by 2010.[31][32] The most common fixed-wing airplane is the Cessna 172, with about 44,000 having been made as of
        2017.[33][34] The Soviet Mil Mi-8, at 17,000, is the most-produced helicopter.[35] The top commercial jet
        airliner is the Boeing 737, at about 10,000 in 2018.[36][37][38] At around 14,000 for both, the most produced
        trams are the KTM-5 and Tatra T3.[39] The most common trolleybus is ZiU-9.

        <h3>Locomotion</h3>
        <p>Locomotion consists of a means that allows displacement with little opposition, a power source to provide the
            required kinetic energy and a means to control the motion, such as a brake and steering system. By far, most
            vehicles use wheels which employ the principle of rolling to enable displacement with very little rolling
            friction.</p>

        <h2>Energy source</h2>
        <p>It is essential that a vehicle have a source of energy to drive it. Energy can be extracted from external
            sources, as in the cases of a sailboat, a solar-powered car, or an electric streetcar that uses overhead
            lines. Energy can also be stored, provided it can be converted on demand and the storing medium's energy
            density and power density are sufficient to meet the vehicle's needs.</p>

    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engine"><strong><ins></ins>Engine</strong></a>
    <p>An engine or motor is a machine designed to convert one or more forms of energy into mechanical energy.[1][2]

        Available energy sources include potential energy (e.g. energy of the Earth's gravitational field as exploited
        in hydroelectric power generation), heat energy (e.g. geothermal), chemical energy, electric potential and
        nuclear energy (from nuclear fission or nuclear fusion). Many of these processes generate heat as an
        intermediate energy form, so heat engines have special importance. Some natural processes, such as atmospheric
        convection cells convert environmental heat into motion (e.g. in the form of rising air currents). Mechanical
        energy is of particular importance in transportation, but also plays a role in many industrial processes such as
        cutting, grinding, crushing, and mixing.</p>
